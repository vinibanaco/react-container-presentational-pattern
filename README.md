# React Container-Presentational Pattern

This is a simple React pattern to help separation of concerns and improve code readability.

Even though Dan Abramov, one of the most important disseminators of the pattern, don't find it
useful anymore (as he explains in the update of
[his article](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0) about
the pattern), I still think it has its advantages.
